The question answering system project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of automatically answering questions based on given passages or documents. This project involves collecting a dataset of question-answer pairs along with relevant passages, preprocessing the text data to extract features and encode contextual information, selecting and fine-tuning pre-trained models such as BERT or similar transformer architectures, and evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

The deployed system will provide users with an efficient and accurate means of retrieving information from large textual sources, with applications in fields such as education, customer support, and information retrieval.
